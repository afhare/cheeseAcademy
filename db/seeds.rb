# The data can then be loaded with the rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).

# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: 'Star Wars' }, { name: 'Lord of the Rings' }])
#   Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)

# flavors.each do |flavor|
#     Flavor.create(kind: flavor)

# milks = ["cow", "goat", "sheep", "buffalo", "raw", "other:nut-based", "other:soy-based", "other"]
